## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend

- **Framework:** Java with Spring Boot.
- **Microservices:**
    - **Application Management Service:** Handles CRUD operations for job applications.
    - **Job Board Integration Service:** Manages API calls and data fetching from job portals.
    - **AI Generation Service:** Interfaces with AI APIs to generate resumes, cover letters, and simulate interviews.
    - **Notification Service:** Listens for email events and triggers interview scheduling.
- **Database:** Utilizes a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for application data and user profiles, complemented
  by Azure Blob Storage for document storage.

### Frontend

- **Web Dashboard:** Built as an interactive single-page application (SPA) using React. Features real-time notifications
  and data visualizations.

### Mobile

- **Companion App:** Developed with Flutter or React Native to provide on-the-go access to dashboard functionalities,
  push notifications (e.g., interview alerts), and scheduling features.

### Containerization & Orchestration

- **Docker:** Containerizes all microservices for consistent runtime environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestrates containers for scalable deployment.
- **Cloud Platform:** Hosted on Azure using AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), Azure App Services, with CI/CD pipelines to
  automate deployments.

## üöß Implementation Considerations

- üîí **Security:**
    - Implements OAuth2/JWT for secure user authentication and authorization.
    - Secures API endpoints and data storage.
- üîç **Error Handling & Logging:**
    - Utilizes centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack) to monitor microservice interactions.
    - Ensures robust error handling, especially with external integrations.
- üìà **Scalability:**
    - Leverages Kubernetes auto-scaling to manage high-demand periods.
    - Decoupled microservices allow independent scaling of resource-intensive components.
- üìã **Compliance & Ethics:**
    - Ensures all API integrations and web scraping comply with platform terms of service.
    - Handles personal data securely in accordance with relevant data protection regulations.
